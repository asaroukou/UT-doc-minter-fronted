Mint a document as an ERC721 to give a proof of history

##About this project
The aim of this project is to provide a platform for scientific prepublication. The main feature of the application is to offer the author to issue indisputable (non-repudiable), irrevocable and simply verifiable (integrity) proof of the uploading of a document. In order to mark this proof of history over time, a blockchain will be used as a distributed ledger in order to sustainably safeguard the information and allow verification of this proof by any entity wishing to do so.

Each `proof` is an NFT (No, Fungible Token) issued on the Ethereum blockchain in the form of an ERC721. The document is when to save it on IPFS.

This repo contain all the frontend and smartcontract source of the [utDoc-minter](https://ut-patent.web.app).
